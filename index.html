            <p class="section-top-p">Assalamualikum (May peace be upon you), As we all may have heard, Sylhet,
                Bangladesh is experiencing one of the worst floods in it's history. Over hundred thousand people
                over the 15 sub-districts in Sylhet are badly impacted. A lot of us are lucky to be born in places
                that are not subjected to natural disasters. As we sit here in the comfort of our own home the
                best we can do is send help to those unfortunate people.
